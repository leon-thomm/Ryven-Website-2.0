                <h3>Ryven Console official release and new inheritance model for widgets</h3>
                <div class="details">
                  <p class="body-text">
                    <p>Ryven Console is now "officially" supported. It is a new app to run project flows from the commandline, without GUI, on a server for example! It follows a similar approach as the recently added builtin console. You can reference nodes and call methods on them. This way you can run a flow for intensive data processing with much higher performance. I'll add a guide to the docs in the future (you probably won't need it). Note that you cannot just run any flow in Ryven Console. It depends on the implementation of the nodes used (any GUI call will be blocked, so if there are some that affect the <em>functionality</em> of the node, it might not work in Ryven Console as expected anymore).</p>
<p>Further changes:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>New inheritence system for widgets</em>: Widget classes should derive from fixed base classes from now on (I updated existing nodes and the template files). This makes them safer and the source code files cleaner (as you don't have to implement all possible methods, they are pre-defined in the base classes).</li>
<li><em>requirements</em>: I added a requirements.txt file for all libraries to run Ryven and the example projects, so it's also convenient to set up a virtual environment now.</li>
</ul>
                  </p>

                <h3>Built-In Interpreter</h3>
                <div class="details">
                  <p class="body-text">
                    <p>Ok, I need to stay focused. I'm very hyped about this.</p>
<p>There is now a complete built-in python interpreter in Ryven, which you will see on the left when starting the application. Main aspects:</p>
<ol>
<li>It's a fully functional REPL, so you can do anything you would do in the normal python console or in IDLE</li>
<li>You can also add object references to single nodes (via right-click), which enables access to their full API. In particular in comparison with the source code editing feature, you can also add, remove, and change attributes, but the possibilities are endless, especially when using references to multiple nodes at the same time. This is extremely useful for developing new nodes, but also for quick access to data that is not being provided as output by the node natively. I strongly encourage anyone who creates nodes to play around with that.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is going to be a major feature of the software in the future.</p>

                    <p>This release represents some major and quite important changes, in particular</p>
<ul>
<li>new linalg package containing nodes representing most basic matrix operations with nice interface</li>
<li>two new designs</li>
<li><strong>heavy improvements in the appearence of source code files, which makes programming nodes much cleaner</strong></li>
<li><strong>new variable update system</strong>: you can now create connections between script variables and methods, so that every time the variable changes, the connected method is called, which enables much more dynamic components (see docs 'API' on the website)</li>
<li>finally a matplotlib package containing a working example. I am planning to add more nodes for analysis related operations there in the future</li>
<li>new internal design management system, so now it's much easier to create new designs, which means there might be a few incoming</li>
<li>passive mode for set var node</li>
<li>and a long list of little fixes and improvements</li>
</ul>

                  <p class="body-text">
                    <p>There are now very useful little checkpoint nodes for active and passive connections. In active mode, they also serve as sequence nodes; you can add exec outputs that get executed from top to bottom after each other.<br>
And some new std nodes and bugfixes.</p>

                  <p class="body-text">
                    <p>There is a new viewport update mode feature you can enable to make a flow update the rectangles in the viewport of nodes when they get executed before the whole execution is over. That enables you to see step by step what happens in the flow when running larger data processing flows (like in the OpenCV example).<br>
Additionally, flows now have their own little settings area for handling the algorithm mode and the viewport update mode I just mentioned. That's because I realized that choosing an appropriate algorithm mode is often a necessity in algorithmic flows; the algorithm for pure data flows doesn't always work there. (it doesn't when some nodes 'secretly' change the values of script variables and I couldn't think of a way yet to autonomously and performantly detect these changes to update the get var nodes when a value of a variable has changed) These settings also get saved to and loaded from project files. Backward compatibility is given.</p>
<p>And I added a sweet little 'bubble sort' example and some basic nodes (there are still quite a few missing).</p>

<li>I fixed some nodes and widgets and added standard line edits including self resizing ones</li>

<li>I moved the package_path for widgets outside of their class (useful for imports of custom classes etc.)</li>
<li>there is a new Extract Property node which is really useful, an example is included in the examples project</li>

                    <p>Ryven finally supports simple node activation animations. Every time a node updates, it starts an animation, making it easy to see what's going on in the flow. They can be disabled.<br>
Furthermore, I updated some designs. In pretty mode, nodes have now shadows and there is a completely new flow design style.</p>
<p><strong>Internal changes</strong><br>
Internally, I furtherly distributed the NodeInstance related classes. I extracted the whole painting process and put it in a separate class NodeInstancePainter. Also, animations are handled by a separate class.</p>

                <div class="details">
                  <p class="body-text">
                    <p>Besides a lot of fine grinding (like adding shortcuts and stuff like that), I slightly changed the method reference retaining mechanism, now using a callable class instead of the m() function. Furthermore, the existing packages experienced a little code revision, I updated a lot of the notations.<br>
All changes are internal. For the user there are just a lot of fixes.</p>
<p><strong>Main internal changes</strong></p>
<p>New M class for method referencing:</p>
<ul>
<li>I implemented the M class which shall be used instead of the m() function for retaining from now on</li>
<li>I updated the template class metacode files</li>
<li>I updated notations and imports in existing packages including comments</li>
<li>I fixed some problems with special_actions</li>
</ul>
<p>Further changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>I finally fixed the layout issues with NodeInstances when adding/removing/changing content. It still needs to rebuild the layout though, but update_shape() calls are not necessary anymore</li>
<li>I fixed a copy,paste,move undo/redo bug</li>
<li>I fixed a lot of nodes and updated notations in their source codes</li>
<li>I fixed a source code update check issue in the NodeManager</li>
<li>I changed the setup_ports() procedure. Now a port gets initialized <em>after</em> the NodeInstance itself.</li>
<li>I added a target option to the Log node to access the default logs</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a website in the making.</p>

<li>the NodeManager experienced a big rework, I reorganized some intern processing and made it cleaner</li>
<li>it now also has source code dialogs to directly edit the metacode of any class</li>
<li>and it detects a change in the original source file, warns the user and lets him choose whether to override or not to</li>
<li>and I updated its stylesheets, now using the same as Ryven</li>
<li>furthermore, I did <em>a lot</em> of small adjustments, enhancements, and improvements to significantly support the workflow</li>
</ul>
<p>Ryven changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>added a function for using method references in metacode files to enable successful method editing in Ryven</li>
<li>changed the source code editing info dialog<br>
fixed a package bug in the val node</li>
<li>added an API method for NodeInstance to provide access to the window's stylesheet</li>
<li>and I changed the structure of saved points in DrawingObjects. Ryven can still load projects using the old signature though</li>
</ul>

                <div class="details">
                  <p class="body-text">
                    <p>Besides reviewing the source code of nodes (NodeInstances) and their widgets in Ryven, <strong>it is now also possible to actually edit a specific object's methods</strong>. More specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>Existing methods can be customized (e.g. for debugging) and further methods can be added. (Note that changing a method actually means relinking the method call to a different method and references linked to the original method still point to the original one, not the customized one. I am looking for a way to change that but I am not entirely sure if that is possible.)</li>
<li>All these changes apply to single instances instead of all objects of the same class.</li>
<li>What can be written manually in Ryven is equal to what can be parsed in the metacode files (the same module environment is being simulated), so all in the object's metacode file additionally added classes, for example, can still be accessed.</li>
<li>All this is accessible through an intuitive GUI in the source code preview area.</li>
<li>All changes are temporary, they do not get saved with the project, so nothing can sustainably be broken. There is also a reset option for every customized class.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's actually funny how ridiculously crazy this is. I did <em>not</em> expect this to be that easy and unlimited. And considering how unexpectedly useful the pure source code <em>preview</em> became, I am really excited about this.</p>
<p><strong>edit: there is a crucial package bug in the new val node when saving/loading a project which will be fixed in the next release.</strong></p>

                <h3>Ryven Official Release</h3>
                <div class="details">
                  <p class="body-text">
                    <p><strong>pyScript became Ryven</strong><br>
While pyScript was pure proof of concept, since the concept has proven very well, I am very pleased to present Ryven.<br>
Ryven is the result of a huge intern code revision of pyScript, reimplementing, and reorganizing a lot of intern processing, making it much cleaner. Furthermore, Ryven includes many features that make learning and using it more efficient and fun.<br>
A new big example project shows the use of OpenCV nodes which represents a very interesting field of application (thanks to miskimit for adding the nodes).<br>
A few of the main improvements for the user:</p>
<ul>
<li>handy source code preview</li>
<li>performance mode for flow editing (important for use on weaker hardware like Raspberry Pi)</li>
<li>algorithm data synchronization modes (for advanced flow optimization, I will add that to the doc in the future)</li>
</ul>
<p>The main internal change is that the geometric organization of the contents of a NodeInstance now uses QGraphicsLayouts - no ugly manual calculations anymore! And I reimplemented the whole selection process recently too, now using the built-in system by QGraphicsScene. Also, the undo/redo system was reimplemented recently, now using references and not relying on the complex index system anymore. All this was part of the process to turn the old pyScript into some much more structured and clean piece of software.</p>
<p>This version runs pretty well and I can't wait to see what it is going to be used for in the future, I am really excited.</p>

                <div class="details">
                  <p class="body-text">
                    <p>Added:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>source code preview!!</strong> You can now see the source code of a placed node inside the editor. A basic syntax highlighting works too. I will enhance it by the ability to also show any node's widget classes in the future.</li>
<li>NodeInstance-and OutputPin highlighting on mouse hover</li>
<li>direct data output value access on mouse hover (over the gate/pin)</li>
</ul>
<p>Reimplemented:</p>
<ul>
<li>the whole selection procedure, now using the built-in system by QGraphicsScene and a std RubberBandSelection</li>
<li>undo/redo system which now does not rely on indices anymore but instead holds references to the actual objects. A removed object does not get recreated when undoing the remove anymore but the actual object just gets placed in the scene again which is pretty nice. (same for all flow commands)</li>
<li>Log enabling/disabling process, now working fine with the new undo/redo system</li>
</ul>
<p>And a lot of small internal adjustments.</p>
<p>The only big change left is the reimplementation of the geometric organization of a NodeInstance's contents via QGraphicsWidgets and QGraphicsLayouts. This will make the code much cleaner but isn't of the essence for the user.</p>
<p><em>I think this one is pretty cool, especially the cleaner selection process is nice, and the code preview makes creating new nodes a lot easier because you can now just look up a node's code directly in the editor.</em></p>

                  <p class="body-text">
                    <p>I removed tokens, now there are no anymore. This enables slightly easier and more open nodes programming.<br>
Along with that, I changed the algorithm executing the script, so that now data connections are always forward updated on change and not backward updated on request. This makes exectution flows slower but pure data flows faster and easier which I like. I would like to create some live video and audio processing nodes in this version to show what it is capable of.</p>
<p>The biggest issue is performance when combining dataflows with execution nodes.</p>

                    <p>The software has officially reached a state where I can do a first pre-release!<br>
Major features are implemented. Along with that, I uploaded a demo video on YouTube about it (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aOn9OsvlXY" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aOn9OsvlXY</a>) as well as the documentation.</p>
<p>The next releases will be about improving the NodeManager and adding new content. The documentation will experience a lot of improvement too, I assume.</p>
